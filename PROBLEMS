Known Problems

Printers
--------

* No difference between de ' and ` quotes.
  This is a printer font problem. A close inspection shows that
  the ' (right quote) is thicker at the top while ` (the left quote) is
  thicker at the bottom.

* Printer: Panasonic KX-P5400. (janet@uniwa.uwa.edu.au)
  The Guide and cover page print fine, except for one thing:  printing the
  cover page leaves the printer in a state where the reference guide does
  not print.  (The printer eats the file:  it appears to process the
  Postscript, then wait for a while for more input, and eventually give up.)
  Resetting the printer (to User Defaults, see page 39 of the the printer
  manual for instructions) fixes it.  Printing a fairly ordinary one-page
  postscript file (some troff output) also fixed it.  I don't know enough
  about the printer or PostScript to be able to say why this problem occurred,
  but it may be worth mentioning it in the documentation.

* Some printers (or printing systems) seem to have problems with the

    %%Feature: *Resolution 300dpi

  line in the postscript file. This line can be safely deleted if needed.

* The PostScript file, as distributed, selects A4 paper format. This
  is intentional, even for US Letter paper format.
  If your printer chokes on this, you can change the line 
 
    a4

  info

    letter

  (And you'll probably have to adjust the document alignment
  parameters as well.) 

LaTeX and DviPS
---------------
* I used TeX 3.1415N with LaTeX2e <1994/12/01> patch level 3.
  Older LaTeX2e versions may work, LaTeX 2.09 will not.

* Dvips is known to work as of version 5.47. I used 5.58a.

Angus Dunnan's PostScript utilities
-----------------------------------
* Makefile.psutils can be used to create A4 based reference copies
  using psutils version 1.13. Your mileage may vary.
