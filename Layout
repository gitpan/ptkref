This is the layout of the pages of the reference guide. The file
README describes how to obtain the correct alignment on the paper.

     left margin


These are the values:
			A4 (cm)	    US Letter (inch)
    text width		 9.0		3.5		same for both
    text height		19.2		7.5		same for both
    top margin	 	 1.0		0.5
    left margin		 4.9		1.6
    right margin	 4.9		1.6
    space between	 2.0		0.8		same for both

After printing double-sided, the pages can be stapled (the ":" in the
picture), folded, and the excess margins cut off. Personally, I cut it
to 11 cm (4 5/16 inch).
